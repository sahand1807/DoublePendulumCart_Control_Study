## 1. Implementation Overview

### 1.1 Software Architecture

The LQR controller implementation consists of three main components:

**Environment** (`env/double_pendulum_cart_env.py`)
- Gymnasium-compatible interface
- MuJoCo 3.0+ physics simulation
- RK4 integrator with dt = 0.01s (100 Hz)
- Angle convention conversion (MuJoCo relative → absolute)

**Dynamics** (`src/system.py`, `src/linearization.py`)
- Numerical equations of motion from Lagrangian mechanics
- Finite-difference linearization around equilibrium
- Controllability verification

**Controller** (`controllers/lqr_controller.py`)
- CARE solver using `scipy.linalg.solve_continuous_are`
- Automatic stability verification
- Configurable Q and R matrices

### 1.2 Design Parameters

**Default LQR Tuning:**
```python
Q = diag([1.0, 100.0, 100.0, 0.1, 10.0, 10.0])
R = 1.0
```

**Resulting Optimal Gain:**
```
K = [1.00, 138.39, -160.55, 2.76, 7.10, -27.05]
```

**Closed-Loop Eigenvalues:**
```
λ = {-11.43, -5.76±2.26i, -3.36, -0.50±0.48i}
```
All eigenvalues have negative real parts → asymptotically stable ✅

## 2. Experimental Setup

### 2.1 Test Scenarios

Three perturbation levels were tested to characterize controller performance:

| Scenario | θ₁ Error | θ₂ Error | Initial x | Initial Velocities |
|----------|----------|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Small** | +2.9° (+0.05 rad) | +1.7° (+0.03 rad) | 0.0 m | [0, 0, 0] |
| **Medium** | +8.6° (+0.15 rad) | +5.7° (+0.10 rad) | 0.1 m | [0, 0, 0] |
| **Large** | +14.3° (+0.25 rad) | +11.5° (+0.20 rad) | 0.0 m | [0.1, 0, 0] |

**Settling Criterion:** Both angles within ±3° for 20 consecutive steps (0.2s)

### 2.2 Performance Metrics

1. **Settling Time (ts)**: Time until system enters and stays within ±3° band

## 4. Parameter Study

### 4.1 Q-Matrix Weight Variation

**Objective:** Understand how state weights affect performance

**Experiments:**

#### Experiment 4.1.1: Angle Weight Sensitivity
Vary θ₁ and θ₂ weights while keeping others constant:
- Baseline: `Q_θ = [100, 100]`
- Conservative: `Q_θ = [50, 50]`
- Aggressive: `Q_θ = [200, 200]`

**Expected Impact:**
- Higher weights → faster response, more control effort
- Lower weights → slower response, less aggressive

**TODO: Run experiments and insert comparison table**

Columns: Q_θ | Settling Time | Control Effort | Peak Force | Overshoot

**TODO: Plot settling time vs Q_θ weights**

#### Experiment 4.1.2: Cart Position Weight
Vary cart position weight to study position vs angle priority:
- `Q_x = [0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0]`

**Expected Impact:**
- Low Q_x: Cart drifts during balancing
- High Q_x: Tighter position control, possible degradation in angle response

**TODO: Cart drift analysis table**

Columns: Q_x | Max Cart Drift | Final x Position | Settling Time


### 4.2 R-Matrix (Control Penalty) Variation

**Objective:** Trade-off between performance and control effort

**Experiments:**

Vary R from 0.1 to 10.0:
- Aggressive: `R = 0.1` (allows large forces)
- Baseline: `R = 1.0`
- Conservative: `R = 10.0` (minimizes forces)

**TODO: Control effort vs R table**

Columns: R | Settling Time | Control Effort | Peak Force | Saturation Rate

**TODO: Pareto curve: settling time vs control effort**

**Expected Trade-off:**
- Lower R → Faster settling, higher forces
- Higher R → Slower settling, gentler forces

## 5. Robustness Analysis

### 5.1 Initial Condition Sweep

**Objective:** Map the region of attraction for the baseline LQR controller by systematically testing a grid of initial angular perturbations.

**Method:**
- Grid sweep: θ₁, θ₂ ∈ [-30°, +30°] around upright equilibrium (π rad)
- Grid resolution: 7×7 points (49 initial conditions total)
- Initial velocities: Zero for all tests
- Cart initial position: x₀ = 0.0 m

**Success Criterion:**
A trial is marked as **successful** if:
1. Both angles reach and stay within ±3° of upright for 1 second (100 consecutive steps), AND
2. The simulation does not terminate early (cart stays within bounds, no divergence)

**Failure Detection:**
- Cart position exceeds ±2.0 m rail limit
- Angular deviation exceeds 60° threshold (early termination)
- Maximum angular deviation during trial exceeds physical limits

### 5.2 Region of Attraction Results

<p align="center">
  <img src="../assets/lqr/initial_condition_region_of_attraction.png" alt="Region of Attraction Analysis" width="1200"/>
  <br>
  <em>Figure 4: Region of attraction analysis for baseline LQR controller. <b>Left:</b> Success/failure map (green = successful stabilization, red = failure). <b>Center:</b> Settling time heatmap for successful cases. <b>Right:</b> Maximum angular deviation with 60° failure threshold marked.</em>
</p>

**Key Findings:**

1. **Success Rate: 32.5%** (16 out of 49 initial conditions)
   - The LQR controller successfully stabilizes from a limited region around the upright equilibrium
   - Success region is roughly centered around θ₁ ≈ 10° to 20°, θ₂ ≈ -10° to 20°

2. **Asymmetric Region of Attraction:**
   - The success region is **not symmetric** about the upright equilibrium (0°, 0°)
   - Better performance for positive θ₁ perturbations (pole 1 forward)
   - Roughly symmetric in θ₂ direction relative to the offset center
   - This asymmetry likely arises from:
     - Coupling between the two pendulums
     - Different masses and lengths (m₁ = 0.3 kg, m₂ = 0.2 kg; l₁ = 0.5 m, l₂ = 0.4 m)
     - Nonlinear dynamics outside the linear regime

3. **Settling Time Variation (Successful Cases):**
   - Range: 0.0s to 2.2s
   - Fastest settling: Near-equilibrium initial conditions (center of success region)
   - Slowest settling: Boundary of the region of attraction
   - Settling time generally increases with distance from equilibrium, as expected

4. **Maximum Deviation:**
   - The right panel shows peak angular error during each trial
   - Dark red/maroon regions: Failures with large deviations (>60°)
   - Yellow/orange regions: Successful cases that stayed well below the 60° threshold
   - Clear boundary visible between controllable and uncontrollable regions

5. **Boundary Characteristics:**
   - The region of attraction boundary is relatively smooth but irregular
   - Sharp transitions from success to failure indicate limited basin of attraction
   - Boundary is **NOT a simple ellipse**, reflecting the nonlinear nature of the system

### 5.3 Interpretation and Implications

**Physical Understanding:**

The limited region of attraction is expected for LQR control of an inverted double pendulum because:

1. **Linear Controller on Nonlinear System:**
   - LQR is designed using linearization around upright equilibrium
   - Validity of linear approximation degrades rapidly with angular displacement
   - Beyond ~15-20° perturbations, nonlinear effects dominate

2. **Underactuated System:**
   - One control input (cart force) must stabilize two pendulums (6 states)
   - Complex coupling between cart motion and both pendulum angles
   - Limited control authority (±20N force limit)

3. **Actuator Saturation:**
   - For large initial errors, required control forces exceed ±20N limit
   - Saturation degrades performance and can lead to instability
   - Linear control law assumes no saturation

**Comparison to Theory:**

- The observed region of attraction is consistent with expectations from nonlinear control theory
- For inverted pendulum systems, basin of attraction typically forms a bounded region around the unstable equilibrium
- The asymmetry is a known phenomenon in coupled multi-link pendulums due to gravitational and inertial coupling

**Practical Implications:**

1. **Swing-Up Required:** For initial conditions outside the region of attraction, a **swing-up controller** would be needed to first bring the system into the basin before switching to LQR
2. **Robust to Small Perturbations:** Within the success region, the controller demonstrates reliable stabilization
3. **Predictable Performance:** The smooth variation in settling time allows prediction of closed-loop behavior
4. **Disturbance Rejection Limits:** External disturbances that push the system beyond the boundary will cause failure

### 5.4 Future Robustness Studies

The following analyses would further characterize controller robustness:

**Initial Velocity Sensitivity:**
- Add random initial velocities θ̇₁, θ̇₂ ∈ [-0.5, +0.5] rad/s
- Test whether region of attraction shrinks with non-zero initial velocities
- Analyze energy considerations (kinetic vs. potential energy limits)

**Measurement Noise:**
- Simulate Gaussian sensor noise: σ_angle ∈ [0.001, 0.01, 0.05] rad, σ_velocity ∈ [0.01, 0.1, 0.5] rad/s
- Quantify performance degradation vs. noise magnitude
- Potential mitigation: Kalman filter or complementary filter

**Model Mismatch:**
- Test with ±10% parameter uncertainty in masses, lengths, inertias
- Evaluate sensitivity to system identification errors
- Compare to adaptive control or robust control approaches

**Disturbance Rejection:**
- Apply impulse forces to cart at random times
- Measure maximum disturbance magnitude that keeps system in basin
- Characterize recovery time after disturbances
